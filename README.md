# Asset Alyze
This is a software that allows you to craft your investment portfolio to reduce unecessary unsystematic risks, based on your expected returns and risk apetite. It allows the use of natural language to modify parameters, backtest etc. It will be worked on during the summer.

## Motivation
This is based on the content taught in [FIN2704](https://nusmods.com/courses/FIN2704/finance). In summary, the course talks about the possibility of creating a portfolio that has zero unsystematic risk through diversification. In other words, it is possible for users to optimize their current portfolio such that they can still get the same expected returns, but with less risk. This software aims to reduce the cost of unecessary unsystematic risk to layman who do not have the know-how and time to create their portfolio through research and mathematical analysis.

## Planned feature
- Natural language to give commands and interact with the interface
- Web scrape historical data and (hopefully) up to date financial data
- Modify parameters such as expected returns, risks
- Tabular and graphical visualization
- Integration with 3rd party apps like TigerTrade (import current assets to visualize)
- Suggest improvements to portfolio

## Start
```
npm run dev
